All quality contributions are welcome, including small typo fixes.
Note that we will review changesets, and may require amendments if we
detect any problems.

A list of current open tasks can be found in the
https://github.com/shlomif/fortune-mod/blob/master/README.asciidoc[README]

Pull requests through GitHub are accepted. You can also send “diff -u”
patches to https://www.shlomifish.org/me/contact-me/[Shlomi Fish].

If possible, please create a dedicated branch for any changes. This
isn't a deal breaker though, as it is an easy fix with git. Moreover, every
atomic change should preferably be in its own git commit.

Happy hacking!
